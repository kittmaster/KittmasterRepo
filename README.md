### Installation ( 2 options )

1. Install by zip file ( No auto updates ) 
2. Install Kittmaster's Repository ( Auto update notifications & installation )

Note: The skin is a derivative retooled version of an official Kodi repository skin, it may never make its way into the official Kodi repository, so GitHub will be the primary source of updates going forward for Madnox v3. This statement is written 2/24/2024 by Kittmaster.

### Translations
We will do our best to support as many languages as possible, this will be an ongoing effort as there are multiple issues with getting the skin from an archive status to a future capabilities to support Omega and future revisions of Kodi. This will be a parallel effort as the skin continues to evolve.
