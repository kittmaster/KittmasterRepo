### <ins>Installation</ins> ( 2 options )

1. Install by zip file ( No auto updates ) 
2. Install Kittmaster's Repository ( Auto update notifications & installation )

Note: The Madnox skin is a derivative retooled version of an official Kodi repository skin, from what I was told, it was to be submitted to the official Kodi repository but never made its way due to the author's life priorities. Knowing that it was destined for submission to the official Kodi repository, we will work to meet that same goal as development restarts and brings the skin into the latest conformity standards. Until that process and testing standard is complete, GitHub will be the primary source of updates going forward for Madnox v3. This statement is written/modified on 3/01/2024 by Kittmaster.

2. Download the zip by clicking the download icon (Download raw file -> left of the pencil).
3. Start Kodi and go to System -> Settings -> Add-ons and select "Install from zip file".
4. Browse for the file downloaded and press "OK".
5. The skin and dependencies will now be installed, this may take a few minutes.

5. When complete, you will be asked if you would like to keep the new skin, select "Yes".


### <ins>Translations</ins>
We will do our best to support as many languages as possible, this will be an ongoing effort as there are multiple issues with getting the skin from an archive status to a future capabilities to support Omega and future revisions of Kodi. This will be a parallel effort as the skin continues to evolve and one of the lowest priorities until I can stabilize modifications for bugs and incoming Omega release build requirements.
