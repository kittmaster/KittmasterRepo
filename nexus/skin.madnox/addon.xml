		<news>v.21.02.01
			-* Global *-
			-Minor version increase to 21.02.01.
			-(WIP) (Long Term) - Begin migration from Embuary Helper to TMDb Helper. Not a trivial change, maintained as much of the physical workflow as possible, some minor changes have been made and cannot be reverted to old methods, adoption should be easily understood.
			-Restructured Information dialog to support Person/Bio info into same dialog structure.
			-Multiple additions to Meta data fields providing more online and local data media labels.
			-Choice of large or small Madnox logo on startup.
			-Added Left/Right arrows for metadata when value is greater than 8 items for visual cue.
			-User adjustable time interval for Left/Right arrow slide (i.e. how often it switches if greater than 8 items).
			-Added countdown timer to display Left/Right switching duration and switch point (visual cue).
			-Added icons to various dialogs like "effects" for snow/leaves to visually display icon in dialog selection.
			-Added Madnox logo to all dialog popups.
			-Updated multiple strings to add uniqueness and better user experience diverging from cookie cutter phrases.
			-Added Recommendations panel to TMDb display dialog.
			-Added additional icons, feedback, graphical elements based on restructured layout to TMDb Infopage.
			-Fixed aspect ratio for "Videos" and removed limit of 2 in TMDb Infopage.
			-Aspect Ratio and Resolution icons colors can be set globally in the admin panel (10 options).
			-Entirely retooled color picker dialog replacing Kodi's built-in version allowing slider control of RGBA.
			-Local script logging enable/disable, defaults to off to prevent bloating KODI log file for debugging.
			-Automatic download of baseline image collections (weather, studio etc.), can be removed or replaced as needed. Rationale: provide better start point of visuals since most users can be overwhelmed on what they should or should not use based on taste/workflow. Default download and enable will provide a better user experience and will not affect lower tier hardware as it requires minimal space requirements.
			-Removed errant label in system info right side panel
			-Multiple mini scripts to replicate Embuary Helper to maintain core functionality, including play all, color picker, and new feature adds.
			-Added Skin Variables addons to add additional capability to replicate local related type movies and future capability updates and features.

			-Updated Infoline with additional icons below main title.
			-Added feedback on rollover of panel data across all buttons.

			-* Movies *-

			-Added all relevant meta tags in grid based on TMDb Helpers tag structure retrieval.
			-Updated Infoline and icons below main title with several revised icons.
			-Several string updates for uniformity between dialogs
			-Increased icon sizes in Infoline.			
			
			-* TV Shows *-
			-Added color control to TV Show returning/air date from grey to color picker selection with persistence.
			-Updated icons for returning, not returning.
