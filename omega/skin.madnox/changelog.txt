v.21.02.01
-* Global *-
-Minor version increase to 21.02.01.
-WIP (Long Term) - Begin migration from Embuary Helper to TMDb Helper. Not a trivial change, maintained as much as physical workflow as possible, some minor changes have been made and cannot be reverted to old methods, adoption should be easily understood.
-Restructured Information dialog to support Person/Bio info into same dialog structure.
-Multiple additions to Meta data fields providing more online and local data medialabel.
-Choice of large or small Madnox logo on startup.
-Added Left/Right arrows for metadata when value is greater than 8 items for visual cue.

-Entirely retooled color picker dialog replacing Kodi's built-in version allowing slider control of RGBA.
-Local script logging enable/disable, defaults to off to prevent bloating KODI log file for debugging.
-Automatic download of baseline image collections (weather, studio etc.), can be removed or replaced as needed.

Default download and enable will provide a better user experience and will not affect lower tier hardware as it requires minimal space requirements.
